# pygame-experiment

## Todo for students
- Make obstacles randomly and endlessly appear
- Make the game more difficult over time, for example
  - make obstacles faster
  - increase the number of obstacles
  - make the gap between obstacles smaller
- Game over Screen
- Scoring system, and show it at the game over screen or at the main menu screen, for example
  - Score increases over time?
  - Increase score for every obstacle that passes you?
- Highscore System
  - Save highscore to file and load it when the game starts
  - Show highscore on game over screen or main menu screen

## Additional Ideas / Things to do
- Powerups
  - Instead of only Obstacles, also have Powerups that you can collect that give you a special power for a moment
  - For example, a powerup that makes you invincible for a moment
- Sound Effects
- Randomize Asteroids that spawn in (Asteroid2-4.png)
