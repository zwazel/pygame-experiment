# pygame-experiment

## Todo for students
- Install pygame
- Make obstacles randomly and endlessly appear
- Make the game more difficult over time, for example
  - make obstacles faster
  - increase the number of obstacles
  - make the gap between obstacles smaller
- Game over Screen
- Scoring system, and show it at the game over screen, for example
  - Score increases over time?
  - Increase score for every obstacle you pass?

  - Show highscore on game over screen

## Additional Ideas / Things to do
